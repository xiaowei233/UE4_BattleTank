# UE4_BattleTank
## About this project
This is a learning/practice project for getting myself hands on the Unreal Engine, in order to learn the engine from scratch little of the engine content is used for granted (e.g. the camera and vehicle moving system are created by myself for scratch).  
 Some simple techniques like __forward declaration, pointer protection, observer pattern usage, delegates and callbacks__ are used to facilate the development of this project.
## What to expect from this game
Back to talking about this project, it is a simple tank battling game in which player can drive a tank and shoot huge projectiles and take damge from enemy tank and die happily. No matter where you go AI tank will have your location and will navigate into your sight and fire at you...~~These AI controlled tanks are way too strong as of now.~~
## What will be updated
1. The accuracy at which the AI tank is able to aim and fire right now.
1. The terrain needs some rework, at least it needs to be expanded.
1. A proper "You Are Dead" UI which allow player to restart.
1. Some tweak on the tank moving, tank can still fly right now, that's not good.
1. Probably some exciting audio for the "huge projectiles"
1. While we are at talking about projectiles, right now make tanks capable of firing dead tanks onto one another?
